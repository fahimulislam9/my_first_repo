     <h3 class="blog-heading">This is about my shitty life</h3>
     <small>Author : <span class="author">Fahim</span> </small>
     <p>The weekend is always something interesting to me. I enjoy that time a lot. Spending five busy days in school with lots of homework pressure is hard. That’s why I try my best to enjoy the two days at the weekend. When I go to bed on Friday night, I feel so much relief because I have not any alarm and I can sleep as much as I want. <br>
     <strong>And then usually I visit any of our relatives on Saturday and Sunday we entire family go to the church. Overall my weekend is full of family functions. I enjoy with all a lot.</strong>  </p>
